# Build a Random Quote Machine  

Code challenge at FreeCodeCamp:

---

This fetches quotes from Tadas Talaikis' [Random Quotes API](https://talaikis.com/random_quotes_api/), then uses the 'cat' (category) property of each one to search for a random picture to display using [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/).  It's interesting to see the relationship of the pics to the quote displayed, as they're coming from two different sources. Some fit perfectly, others are funny, and some are just weird. LOL
